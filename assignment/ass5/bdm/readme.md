# Automated Feature Engineering Tools Assignment

In this assignment, you will explore the fascinating world of automated feature engineering tools in data science. Automated feature engineering is a critical step that can save time and improve the quality of features used for machine learning models.

## Task Overview
1. **Dataset Selection**: Your first task is to select a suitable dataset for this assignment. You can choose a dataset from various sources, such as Kaggle, UCI Machine Learning Repository, or any other relevant dataset source. Make sure the dataset is in a format that can be easily loaded into Google Colab.

2. **Loading the Dataset**: Use Python libraries like Pandas to load the selected dataset into your Colab notebook. You can upload the dataset from your local machine or load it directly from an online source.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Perform a basic exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset's characteristics. This includes checking for missing values, understanding the data types, and getting a sense of the dataset's structure.

4. **Feature Engineering with Automated Tools**: In this assignment, you will explore and use automated feature engineering tools to generate new features from the dataset. Some popular libraries for automated feature engineering include Featuretools, TPOT, and AutoML tools like H2O.ai. Choose one or more of these tools and apply them to your dataset.

5. **Feature Selection**: After generating new features with automated tools, select the most relevant ones for your analysis. You can use techniques like feature importance or domain knowledge to choose the most important features.

6. **Visualization**: Visualize the transformed and newly created features to gain insights into their distributions and relationships with the target variable.

7. **Conclusion**: Summarize your findings, the feature engineering steps you've taken with automated tools, and why you made those decisions.

## Submission
1. Create a new Markdown document in Google Colab and name it "feature_eng_tool.md"

2. Provide clear and organized explanations of each step in your Markdown document using appropriate headings and bullet points.

3. Include Python code snippets where necessary to demonstrate your implementation of automated feature engineering tools.

4. Attach your Colab notebook (`.ipynb` file) with all the code, annotations, and visualizations to your submission.

5. Make sure to include your name, student ID, and the date in the Markdown document.

6. Share the Markdown document and Colab notebook with your instructor as instructed for evaluation.

üöÄ Form project teams comprising a minimum of three and a maximum of four students. Teamwork is essential for this assignment. Please complete the Google Sheets page with your group information [**here**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WJWrzrGmfC0z5CmTYCGmlkKa7_byYOoxlU0MTg7pRrk/edit#gid=433067553).
